AutoHandbrake
=============

A command-line wizard to speed up ripping DVDs and converting videos with HandBrakeCLI.

Can operate on a DVD in drive DEVICE, or a directory DIR containing titles ripped from
a DVD or Blu-Ray, for example by MakeMKV.

Scans DEVICE for titles and subtitles, attempts to detect groups of episodes, then creates
and executes HandBrakeCLI commands based on command-line arugments or answers to interactive
prompts.

When scanning, any titles shorter than DURATION (if specified) will be ignored.  The script
will look at the remaining titles and attempt to find a group of sequential, similar-length
titles matching the length of the DVD's main feature.  If found, it will offer to rip this
group as a set of sequentially-numbered episodes, otherwise it will offer to rip the main
feature.  If detection is unsuccessful or incorrect, the user can override the titles to be
ripped.

    Requirements:
        HandBrakeCLI
        Ruby >= 2
        Ruby gems: optparse, duration, mattscilipoti-rdialog
